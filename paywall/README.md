# Paywall 

This folder is for any research paper behind a paywall or other inaccessible means regarding LGBTQ data and/or research. The papers or data in this directory are not screened beyond meeting basic criteria for this repository, vetting the quality of papers is beyond the scope of this repository. This is meant as a holding of papers that can be parsed for data or simply used for research purposes.

We ask that anyone that has access to such LGBT papers or data AND is willing to submit an issue so they can be used for public data science, would be greatly appreciated.




## Folder

- `papers` is to just hold research papers that are in `pdf` format from any discipline and are within 10 years (ideally) of being published.
